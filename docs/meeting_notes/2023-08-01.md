# DevOps Meeting Notes

## Agenda

- We need to come to a decision on the infrastructure migration idea.
- We should discuss [where we want to place meeting
  minutes](https://github.com/python-discord/infra/issues/108).
- Let's clean up our [kubernetes repo pull
  requests](https://github.com/python-discord/kubernetes/pulls).
- We should find a way to deal with the test failures in the infra repository
  due to linting the Ansible playbooks. Do we fix it? Do we remove the linter?
  For instance, [PR #110](https://github.com/python-discord/infra/pull/110)
  bumps `dnspython` (which is only used as a lookup plugin), but CI fails.
